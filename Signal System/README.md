# Introduction

These notebooks were made as a part of implementation and exploration of material and subject matter learned during Signals and Systems Course- in my Freshman year

The project has to modules
1. To denoise the signal
    * uses Gaussian denoising technque

2. To deblur the signal
    * Uses DFT and IDFT to recover the deblurred signal.
