#Introduction
These notebooks were made as a part of implementation and exploration of material and subject matter learned during Probability and Stats course- in my Sophomore year

[How often does the better team win](https://github.com/ceyxasm/implementations/blob/main/probability%20and%20stats/ipl.ipynb)
* Discussed the role of probability in sports from the prespective of IPL and analyzed some questions like

* Can we be certain that better team did indeed win?

* How does the probability of a team winning one match translate to winning the entire season

* Does RCB play bad or are they just unlucky?


[Law of large numbers](https://github.com/ceyxasm/implementations/blob/main/probability%20and%20stats/law_of_large_numbers.ipynb)
In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed. Same was simulated and inferences were drawn of its consequences.
