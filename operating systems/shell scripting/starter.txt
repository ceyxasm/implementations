DEMO

1. cat /etc/shells- gives available shell
	which bash: gives location of bash
2. there are two types of variables in shell
	User variables: 
	System variables: maintained by the the OS, usually in capital case

3. variables should not start with number
4. commenting can be done using #
5. input can be read from terminal using read command
	read var_name
5.1 to take input on same line
	read -p 'message ' var_name

6. for hidden inputs
	read -sp 'message' bar_name

7. default variable in which our input goes in after input is REPLY
8 to take array inputs
	read -a var_name

9. PASS ARGUMENTS TO A BASH SCRIPT:
a) when arguments are passed it is by default stored in $1, $2, $3 
b) name of the script goes in $0
c) arguements can also be parsed as an array
	args= ("$@")
	while in $ parsing; the arguments are named from 1 2 3.... with 0 being the script name, in case of array parsing, the arguments start from 0 index itself
d) echo $# gives us the number of arguments

10. FILE OPERATIONS
	echo -e "message: \c" ##keeps the cursor on the same line
	a) if [ -e file_name ] : flags for the existence of file
	b) -f checks if its regular file or not
	c) -d checks for directories
	d) -b checks for block special files
	e) -c checks for character special file
	f) -s checks if file is empty or not	[if true, then not empty]
	g) -r, -w, -x can be used to check if we have read, write and execute perms or not
file can be two types: 
	charachter file: text data 
	block file: binary/img/vid/mp3
