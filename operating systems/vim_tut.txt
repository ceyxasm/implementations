tutorial for vim
---------------
(following this tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiwGbcd8S7I)
1. in non-insert mode,
	:q to quit
	:wq to save and quit
	:q! to quit without saving
	:w to just save

2. by default we are in command mode when we enter vim
3. pressing i helps u enter insert mode and pressing escape exits command mode
4. in command mode, pressing 'dd' deletes a line, and copies it in  clipboard
		9dd will delete 9 lines of code 
	j to go down
	k to go up
	h to go left
	l to go right
	w takes us to the next word
	b takes us to the previous word
	:30 will take us to line 30
	0w to start of a line
	$ for end of the line
	W ignores puntcuations and same goes for B
	t! will take us to the ! in the line
	D to delete rest of the line
5. other way to navigate is
	'gg' to reach top
	'G' to reach bottom
	'}' skip code blocks forwards
	'{' skip code blocks backwards
	50k makes u go 50 lines down
	20j makes u go 20 lines up (same for h and l, { and })
6. u in command undoes previous mess-up ( a dd? )
7 in the same time ctrl+r is redo
8. '.' redoes previous command
9. in command mode, yy to copy a line and p to paste it (creates a new line and pastes it below there, while P pastes above)

10. V puts u in visual mode where we can select text by going up and down 
	with this selected text:
	d to delete
	10.1 v to highlight with more flexibility
	10.2 ctrl+v selects column wize

11.another method to enter inset mode is 'o'
	(adds line below and puts u in insert mode; while 'O' adds line above)

12. key expansions are amazing 
	d} deletes an entire block

13. '*' in command mode helps in toggling between different instances of the pointer-term

14. 'x' just deletes the character at the cursor
15. '3r7' eats 3 cursors and replaces them with 7
16. R activates eating cursor 
17. < and > to indend code
18. % shows the opening and closing of the code block we are in
