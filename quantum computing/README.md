# qc_implementations
This repository contains and maintains the code files written while exploring Quantum Computing the its implementation in Machine Learning. Relevant material was then documented into code and pushed here.

To begin with, popular Quantum protocols were implemented like
* Comparison between Q_sphere and Bloch Sphere
* Teleportation
* Entanglement

Further next, various Algorithms and Implementations were materialized
##[Q_implementations](quantum computing/Q_implementations)
* half-adder
* Quantum Coin game
* Quantum random walk
* Pi estimation
* Quantum Fourier Transform
* Super Dense Coding

##[Q_algos](quantum computing/Q_algos)
* Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm
* Grover's Algorithm

For final leg of our exploration, we shifted our focus to Variation Semi-Quantum algorithms and their implementation in QML
##[QML](quantum computing/QML)
* Binary classifier
* Quantum Regressor
